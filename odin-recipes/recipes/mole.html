        <ol>
            <li> Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken pieces and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. Reduce heat to medium; stir in paprika, cloves, cinnamon, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li> Stir in tomatoes, chicken broth, and brown sugar; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Once simmering, stir in chocolate chips until melted, then return chicken pieces to the pot. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is tender and no longer pink at the bone, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in raisins and cook 3 minutes longer. Sprinkle with sesame seeds to serve. </li>
